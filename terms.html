Users must be at least eighteen (18) years old to register as a user of the Loovibe. While Loovibe reserves the right to verify a user&#x27;s age using suitable official documentation, it is not obligated to do so.

      <h3 class="tosmain_h3">4. Free Basic Membership and Paid Services</h3>
      <div class="tosmain_text">4.1 Our free service agreement enables registered users to access the basic features of our dating app (basic user). This includes the ability to view other user&#x27;s data such as image and text files and to communicate with them through electronic messages within the app until the in-app credits are spent. While we provide the technical services to enable communication, we do not guarantee any success in finding matches, marriages or other forms of matchmaking.<br><br>4.2 In addition to the free basic membership, users can choose to purchase additional services from our app for a fee. The pricing and details of these services can be found on our app or within the app&#x27;s description. The fees can be used for single or multiple uses of a service, as a credit for one or more services, for time-dependent use (e.g., days, weeks, etc.), or other forms of use. Supplementary terms and conditions of the respective provider that regulates the applicable payment modalities apply to the fee-based additional services. The user must agree to these supplementary terms before claiming the services, which results in a paid usage relationship. All fees are due upon the conclusion of the contract unless the applicable supplementary terms contain any deviating regulations.<br><br>4.3 The content and scope of the basic functions and the additional paid services offered by our app may be modified, restricted, extended, or discontinued at any time due to continuous further development. If users have already paid fees for services that are subsequently restricted or discontinued or whose use is possible in the future free of charge, the user may require credit to other paid services or a proportionate repayment, if applicable. Any further claims of the user are excluded.</div>

Subscriptions will be automatically extended depending on the chosen period, provided the user does not terminate it within 24 hours&#x27; notice of expiration. Termination of paid usage relationships does not affect the existence of free basic usage and the use of basic functions. To terminate the basic user, the user can delete or cancel their profile according to clause <br><br>5.3. Extraordinary termination without notice for good cause remains unaffected and is governed by statutory provisions.</div>
